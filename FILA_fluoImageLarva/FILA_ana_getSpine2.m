function coords = FILA_ana_getSpine2(boundary,hctPos)
% This function from the fluorescent image larva analysis toolbox (FILA)
% calculates the spine of a polygon in our case the larva. This done by
% using a subset of the boundary coordinates of the larva body as centers
% for a voronoi cell. The resultingcells have a midline border which is an
% approxyimation of the center line of the larva. Unluckily some cells will
% have borders closser to the boundary. We take all points inside the
% polygon using the inpolygon function and filter them heavily with a 3rd
% degree butterworth with cutoff frequency of 0.05.
%
% GETS:
%       boundary = a mx2 matrix with the m 2D positions of the boundary
%                  between the larva and the background.
%
% RETURNS
%         spline = a mx2 matrix with the central line of the polygon
%
% SYNTAX: spline = FILA_ana_getSpine(boundary)
